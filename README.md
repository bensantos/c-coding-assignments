# coding-assignments
A collection of assignments I had to complete for my Computer organization and Architecture class during Winter 2020.
I had a week to complete each assignment.
I believe the assignments showcase my familiarity with C and topics related to it (memory hierarchies, bit representations, x86-64 assembly), as well as my ability to quickly learn and apply new concepts.
