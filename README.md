# coding assignments
A collection of assignments I completed for my Computer Science coursework during my Sophomore year (2019-2020).
I had a week for each individual C assignment, and a longer time for the Python project.
I believe the assignments showcase my familiarity with both languages as well as my ability to quickly learn and apply new concepts.
