# coding portfolio
A collection of programs I have written for my Computer Science coursework during my Sophomore year (2019-2020), and for my internship at UW-La Crosse.
I had a week for to complete individual C assignment, and mutiple weeks to complete both Python based assignments.
I believe the assignments showcase my familiarity with both languages as well as my ability to quickly learn and apply new concepts.
