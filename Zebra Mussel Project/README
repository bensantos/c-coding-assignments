A project I did while interning at UW-La Crosse. The goal of the project was to create a program
that quickly return biological information about Zebra Mussel genes.

Gene.py was code I wrote that took user input and returned information regarding a gene of interest.
The file containing the genome was very large, so I did my best to make sure splicing of the file was 
as efficient as possible. 

The project also introduced me to handling file formats (e.g. FASTA) that are relevant to the field, which was cool!
Not all files are included.
