The backend for a website I helped write during the Fall of 2019 for my Software Design course.
webapp.py uses Flask to render HTML files (not included in this repository) and to run
the proper SQL queries defined in datasource.py.
datasource.py conencts to the database and queries the SQL database.

It's hard to understand the code without seeing the full picture, a general idea:
-the SQL datatable has over 300,000 unique entries
-our site customizes SQL queries based on user inputs
-the code was written over a period of 6 weeks (including CSS and HTML)
